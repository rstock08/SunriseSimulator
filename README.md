# Sunrise Simulator
<b>Problem Statement</b>
<br><br>
At the start of every day, the moment you wake up is critical in setting your mood for each difficult morning. Even though we don’t realize it, the conditions in which we wake up can drastically affect our overall lifestyles. Imagine a scenario where you are well at rest after a full night’s sleep, and it’s the early hours of the morning. The sun is just beginning to rise and break through into your household, but instead of the sun striking your face disturbing your deep sleep, you’re met with a slow and gradual light change over a long period of time that would help you adjust to the drastic light change that happens the second that light breaks through your window. Our solution would be to design a window and curtain system that corresponds with the alarm that you set on your phone the night before. The system will check the time of sunrise the following day and prepare a schedule for the window to function and allow the customer to enjoy their precious moments of rest without being disturbed by natural sunlight.

<b>Objective:</b>
<br><br>
Create a IoT device/network that communicates with an application which can be installed on smart devices. Allow users to control the natural lighting allowed in their room through the phone application and a series of devices.
